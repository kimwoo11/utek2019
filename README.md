# UofT Engineering Competition 2019
Code for the 2019 University of Toronto Engineering Kompetition (UTEK2019) programming challenge.\
All teams were given 6 hours to complete the competition.

### Main Objective
The main objective was to create a path planning algorithm
that allows several robots in a warehouse to efficiently and
optimally collect/discard packages while avoiding obstacles and
other moving robots. Details on the algorithm and methods used
can be found in our [presentation slides](UTEK-2019.pptx).

### Submissions
The competition was made up of 6 parts. More information on each 
section can be found in the [Programming Package PDF file](UTEK-Programming-Package.pdf).

* Part 1: Parsing input
* Part 2: Path planning for a single robot in a warehouse with multiple packages to pick up
* Part 3: Path planning for a single robot with multiple packages to pick up and multiple obstacles to avoid
* Part 4: Path planning for multiple robots with multiple packages to pick up
* Part 5: Path planning for multiple robots with multiple packages to pick up and multiple obstacles to avoid
* Part 6: Simulation tool to help with debugging and simulating our algorithms
